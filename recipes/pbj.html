        <h3>Peanut Butter & Jelly</h3>
        <p>The PB&J is as American as it gets, and its story is 
            spread across the internet from web page to web page 
            as if by digital butter knife, each as recognizable to 
            the next as the sandwich itself. I'll spare you too much 
            of a regurgitation here, except in the broadest strokes: 
            It supposedly started as a fancy-ish tea sandwich at the 
            turn of the 20th century, but quickly became a popular 
            lunchtime snack as an increasingly industrialized food
             system made sliced bread and store-bought jam and peanut
              butter a common and affordable option to Americans of 
              all economic stripes.</p>
